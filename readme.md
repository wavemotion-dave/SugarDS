SugarDS is an Amstrad CPC 646 and 6128 Emulator for the DS/DSi

The Amstrad CPC was released in 1984 and competed with the ZX Spectrum and C64 
in the UK and Eastern EU. Although a latecomer to the market, the solid engineering
"all-in-one" design gathered support. There are still many fans of the system today
and plenty of great homebrew games that fully take advantage of the system strengths.

This emulator is not perfect - but it should be capable enough to render most games
playable on the tiny handheld so you can get your Amstrad gaming on-the-go!

Features :
-----------------------
* Emulates CPC 464 (64K) and CPC 6128 (128K) with 512K of extended RAM available.
* Loads .SNA and .DSK files up to 1024K total length (single and double sided).
* Plus2CPC Cartridge Support to load .CPR files up to 512K (note, this is not a plus/GX4000 emulator but will handle cart files provided they don't require plus-features).
* Partial Dandanator Cartridge Support - Enough for Sword of Ianna and Los Amores de Brunilda. Rename files to .dan to load into the emulator properly.
* Emulates CRTC Type 3 roughly - with provisions to handle split screen, rupture, smooth vertical scroll and a reasonable facsimile of smooth horizontal scroll.
* Full button mapping - supporting all 3 possible joystick buttons of the Amstrad as well as mapping buttons to keyboard keys.
* Full touch-screen Amstrad keyboard styled after the colorful CPC 464.
* Save / Load state so you can pick up where you left off.
* Full support for the Spanish CPC 472 machine with the extra 8K of memory! :)

Bits of pieces of this emulator have been glued and attached from 
a large number of sources - along with a healthy amount of code by 
this author to pull it all together. Although it was hard to trace 
everything to the original sources, I believe all sources have 
released their material under the GNU General Public License and, 
as such, the SugarDS emulator follows suit.

BIOS Files :
-----------------------
Following in the footsteps of virtually all other Amstrad CPC emulators, the BIOS
files are included in the emulator and don't need to be sourced by the user. This
is according to a note from Cliff Lawson:

"If you are the author of such an emulator then you don't need to write and ask me for 
Amstrad's permission to distribute copies of the CPC ROMs. Amstrad's stance on this is
that we are happy for you to redistribute copies of our copyrighted code as long as 
a) copyright messages are not changed and 
b) either in the program or the documentation you acknowledge that "Amstrad has kindly 
given it's permission for it's copyrighted material to be redistributed but Amstrad 
retains it's copyright."

So the Amstrad CPC BIOS files are still copyrighted by Amstrad - in whatever form
that may exist. If you are in an official capacity as the copyright owner of the 
BIOS files and wish these stripped from the emulator, please contact me and I'm 
happy to do so!  Otherwise - many thanks for the indirect permission to use them.

Main Menu :
-----------------------
After the emulator launches (unless you've directly launched a game via Twilight Menu++), you will be 
presented with the main menu screen. From here you can load up a disk or cart file to play.

![image](./png/mainmenu.png)

Filenames can be no longer than 160 characters (and the DS can only display 32 at a time and will scroll
the title of a game as needed) - so please keep your filenames on the shorter side. You can have no more 
than 1024 game files in a directory - but can have as many directories as you want.


Configuration :
-----------------------
There is quite a few configuration options that you can explore. Some options are global for the emulator
and some are specific to one game. Please note that the options are associated with the filename (e.g. your
.dsk file on the SD card) of the game you are playing. If you change the filename, the options will have
to be re-entered.

![image](./png/options.png)
![image](./png/global.png)

When you change options, you must hit the START button on the DS to save out the new configuration to your SD card. 
Otherwise the options will only work for this game play session.

If you are playing a game like Robocop, Chase HQ or Manic Miner which hits the AY sound chip hard to produce "speech" or 
similar digitizied effects, you should set the **Sound Driver** to 'WAVE DIRECT'. This is a bit more taxing on the emulator
but it will render speech and other digitized effects quite well.

Of primary importance to gameplay are these two: **R52 vSync** and **CPU Adjust**.

Normally you shouldn't touch either adjustment... unless the game is not running correctly. In that case, try the following:

* If the game is running slower than on real hardware (e.g. Dizzy III which slows down when you move) then adjust the R52 vSync to 'Forgiving'.
* If the game has minor graphical glitches - say a stray line (e.g. Sword of Ianna on screen transitions) then try a CPU Adjust of -1 or -2 at most.

Because the emulator is doing line-based (vs cycle-based) emulation, the accuracy is only to that of a scanline and sometimes these small tweaks are 
necessary to get games running as close as possible to real hardware.

A number of commercial games will be auto-recognized and will have some tweaks automatically selected so they run as close to perfect as I can get them.

Mode 2 (up to 640 horizontal pixels) is a bitch for the poor little DS with only 256 pixel resolution. To that end, we have a mode 2 setting called 
'PAN+SCAN' which renders the screen much bigger but requires that you press the upper left/right (where the AMSTRAD logo is) of the touch screen to 
scroll left/right. This will allow games like Orion Prime to be playable so you can actually read the emails you're getting in-game.

One option that can be handy for certian ladder or maze games is the D-Pad "Slide-n-Glide" which was designed originally for my ZX Spectrum emulator and
specifically for Chuckie Egg. Sometimes with climbing/maze games it's hard to make the exact turn onto a ladder. With 'Slide-n-Glide', the controls will be
more forgiving by continuing to move in the Left/Right or Up/Down direction for a few more frames while another direction is pressed. This makes it much (much!)
easier to navigate onto and off of ladders in games like Chuckie Egg... Maze Games (pacman, etc) also benefit.

Key Mapping :
-----------------------
Any of the non shoulder buttons can be mapped to any joystick button and/or keyboard key.

![image](./png/keymap.png)

The shoulder buttons are special:

Shoulder button L + D-Pad for offset
Shoulder button R + D-Pad for scale (turn off auto-scale)

It's critical that you use the L/R buttons to shift/scale the screen as the Amstrad
CPC will often utilize more pixels than the DS has resolution (192 vertical pixels)
so you will be forced to either compress (squash) the screen or else position the 
screen carefully and map one of the buttons to PAN UP or PAN DOWN the screen briefly.
This works really well for games that show status or score at the top or bottom of 
the screen but otherwise doesn't really affect the main gameplay area. 

DISK Support :
-----------------------
.DSK files up to the maximum allowed by 3.5" drives using PARADOS is roughly 720K. Most
disks should auto-load but if your disk does not, it should provide a catalog of the
possible filenames that could be used to run the program. One trick is to include
the command you want to run in the filename of the .DSK file itself. That helps the
auto-type detection algorithm. To force a very specific run command, place the name
of the Amstrad CPC file you wish to run in double brackets like this:

"Orion Prime 3_5 Inch Disk [[ORION]].dsk"

This when that .dsk file is loaded, the emulator will sense what's between the double
brackets and issue the proper RUN "ORION" command

Note that sometimes one disk version of a game won't load properly but a different version will.
Keep looking - you're very likely to find a version that will load and play correctly. Such is
life with emulation and potentially dodgy disk dumps.

Cartridge Support :
-----------------------
Although .CPR cartridges up to 512K are supported, this is not a CPC+ (plus) emulator.
So games like ALCON 2020 work fine... as do any other .CPR games that do not specifically
utilize the GX4000 or Amstrad CPC+ (plus) graphics capabilities. 

Dandanator Support :
-----------------------
Mainly to run two games - Sword of Ianna and Los Amores de Brunilda. Rename those .rom
files as .dan files so that they will be loaded as Dandanator files within the SugarDS
emulator. Note that we do not support Flash writes on these carts - but the games
themselves should be playable and you can use the normal emulator save/load states
to save your progress.

SNA Support :
-----------------------
Memory snapshots are supported for both 64K and 128K machines as well as expanded 576K machines.
You should strongly prefer to use .DSK or .CPR (or .DAN) files as snapshots cannot save data nor can they multi-load
and the .dsk emulation is fast enough that the difference between a disk load and a snapshot load is just a few
extra seconds. Think about how long it took to load stuff from cassette/disk when we were kids ... we're so spoiled now!

Known Issues :
-----------------------
* Pinball Dreams has graphical glitches on the opening lead-in screens... gameplay is better.
* R-Type Reloaded 128K does not load correctly except for the 3-disk version which does work (despite some loading screen issues).
* Megablasters has issues with the emulated CRTC type detection and won't start except for one version which I've added a patch for: The 2020 ENGLISH Re-Release version (4 disks).
* Enlightenment (aka Druid 2) has major graphical glitching. Cause is likely CRTC timing issues.
* Turrican 128K works fine with the two disk version but the single disk version has issues. 

Version History :
