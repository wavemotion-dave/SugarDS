Bits of pieces of this emulator have been glued and attached from 
a large number of sources - along with a healthy amount of code by 
this author to pull it all together. Although it was hard to trace 
everythign to the original sources, I believe all sources have 
released their material under the GNU General Public License and, 
as such, the SugarDS emulator follows suit.

If I've misrepresented any pervious authors work here, please 
contact me and I'll put it right.

As far as I'm concerned, you can use this code in whatever way suits you provided you 
continue to release the sources under the original copyright notice (see below) which
appeared to be the intention of all the pioneers who came before me.

The sound driver (ay38910) are libraries from FluBBa (Fredrik Ahlstr√∂m) 
and those copyrights remain his.

The SugarDS emulator is offered as-is, without any warranty.


BIOS Files :
-----------------------
Following in the footsteps of virtually all other Amstrad CPC emulators, the BIOS
files are included in the emulator and don't need to be sourced by the user. This
is according to a note from Cliff Lawson:

"If you are the author of such an emulator then you don't need to write and ask me for 
Amstrad's permission to distribute copies of the CPC ROMs. Amstrad's stance on this is
that we are happy for you to redistribute copies of our copyrighted code as long as 
a) copyright messages are not changed and 
b) either in the program or the documentation you acknowledge that "Amstrad has kindly 
given it's permission for it's copyrighted material to be redistributed but Amstrad 
retains it's copyright."

So the Amstrad CPC BIOS files are still copyrighted by Amstrad - in whatever form
that may exist. If you are in an official capacity as the copyright owner of the 
BIOS files and wish these stripped from the emulator, please contact me and I'm 
happy to do so!  Otherwise - many thanks for the indirect permission to use them.
