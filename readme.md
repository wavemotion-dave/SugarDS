Bits of pieces of this emulator have been glued and attached from 
a large number of sources - along with a healthy amount of code by 
this author to pull it all together. Although it was hard to trace 
everythign to the original sources, I believe all sources have 
released their material under the GNU General Public License and, 
as such, the SugarDS emulator follows suit.

If I've misrepresented any pervious authors work here, please 
contact me and I'll put it right.

As far as I'm concerned, you can use this code in whatever way suits you provided you 
continue to release the sources under the original copyright notice (see below) which
appeared to be the intention of all the pioneers who came before me.
